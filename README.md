# ActorCrate: Simulated Agents for Research, Training, and Exploration

## Purpose
ActorCrate is a modular software framework for instantiating high-fidelity simulated agents based on public figures, archival data, or user-provided corpora. It enables researchers, educators, and developers to interact with, observe, and stress-test agent behavior in controlled, scenario-driven environments—bridging AI, digital humanities, and ethical simulation.

## Core Modules
- **Corpus Ingestion:** Automated pipelines for processing transcripts, writings, videos, and metadata into structured, agent-ready datasets.
- **Agent Libraries:** Instantiates agents with toggleable personality traits (e.g., extraversion, cynicism, trauma), supporting both historical fidelity and speculative modes.
- **Simulation Layer:** Scenario engine for constructing environments with time/place settings, external data overlays, and narrative prompts. Supports agent-agent and agent-environment interactions.
- **UX Interface:** Markdown-style outputs clearly distinguish [Agent Speech], [Agent Actions], [Admin Logs], [Emotional State], and more. Supports both terminal and GUI sandbox modes.
- **Governance / Guardrails:** Enforces ethical constraints (e.g., no private individuals without consent, mandatory speculative inference flags), with audit logs and consent management.

## Inputs
- Public or user-provided corpora (text, audio, video)
- Metadata (dates, locations, affiliations)
- Scenario definitions (settings, prompts, overlays)
- Admin/user trait adjustments and simulation controls

## Outputs
- Structured agent interactions ([Speech], [Actions], [Emotional State])
- Scenario logs and behavioral drift reports
- Exportable data for research or integration
- Audit trails for ethical compliance

## User Experience
- Root-level users interact with agents in a sandboxed environment, adjusting traits and observing emergent dialogue or behavior.
- Markdown-style interface provides clarity and auditability.
- Scenario builder allows rapid prototyping of testnet environments.
- Ethical guardrails are transparent and enforceable, with clear flagging of speculative or sensitive content.

## Backend Needs
- Scalable NLP and multimodal embedding pipelines
- Secure, versioned storage for corpora and agent states
- Real-time simulation engine with event logging
- Modular API for integration with external research or training platforms
- Governance layer for consent, audit, and ethical review

ActorCrate is designed for extensibility, ethical rigor, and cross-domain research—enabling safe, transparent exploration of simulated cognition and social dynamics.
